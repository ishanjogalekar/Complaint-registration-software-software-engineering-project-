# vCOMPLAIN - Online Complaint Registration and Management System (OCRMS) 
## For CSE3001 (Software Engineering) J component, vCOMPLAIN is a project initiative undertaken by Ishan Sagar Jogalekar, Siddharth Chatterjee, Anay Bhatkar Minesh and Subham Satnalika.
A Complaint arises through discontent or dispute at any level in an organization. If the organization is an academic institution, then this issue becomes more sensitive and important. Students at these educational institutions often fail to express and sometimes fail to seek proper support for the issues they face. 
vCOMPLAIN is a simple complaint portal to receive and act on complaints reported by students of VIT, enabling prompt actions on any issue raised by them and to avail services more effectively. We have prototyped on both a mobile application and a web application.
